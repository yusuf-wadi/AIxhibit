This is a project for my 4347 Database Systems class at UTD.

## Description

The goal for this project was to create a database system that emulates an art exhibit, displaying an artists name and artwork upon request.

The twist here is that there are no invalid queries, as the code will generate the artists description and artwork if it does not exist in the database, then it will insert it into the database.
